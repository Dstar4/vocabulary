# vocabulary
A place to share vocabulary definitions and learning resources.

I would like to get a sheet of vocabulary words and definitions together to look back on and help everyone study. I feel that as we start going through the interview process, being able to explain concepts in a succinct manner, using the proper terminology will help us stand out from other candidates. I you are interested in contributing please just submit a PR and I will merge into master once I have verified that the format is correct so we have some uniformity. 

Your submission should be in this format.

vocabulary word {
definition: Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions.

description: Template literals are enclosed by the back-tick (` `)  (grave accent) character instead of double or single quotes. Template literals can contain placeholders. These are indicated by the dollar sign and curly braces (${expression}).
